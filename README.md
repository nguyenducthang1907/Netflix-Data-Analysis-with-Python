# üìä Netflix Data Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis** of the Netflix dataset using **Python**.  
Libraries used: **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**.  

The workflow covers: **data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, insights, and recommendations**.

## üöÄ Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded dataset with `pandas`
- Explored shape, columns, missing values
- Previewed first 20 rows

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted `date_added` ‚Üí `datetime`
- Extracted numeric values + units from `duration`
- Handled missing values in `director`, `cast`, `country` (filled with `"Unknown"`)
- Added `main_country` column for the first listed country

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We focused on 5 main perspectives:
1. Content distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)  
2. Trends over time (titles added per year)  
3. Content by country (top producers)  
4. Genre distribution (most common categories)  
5. Duration by rating (movie lengths vs audience category)
